## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: Whatsapp
- You can change the background of the messages 
- You can call and text anyone in any country 
App: Fruit ninja
- The UI/UX is pretty and fun
- I like the sound effects
App: Duolingo 
- The notifications and gamification is motivating 
- You can play at any time 

App Idea: Hydrocat or H2Ocat: tracks how much water you drink but gamified. As you update how much you drink throughout the day you make sure that your cat is happy and healthy. If you do not drink enough water and do not update how much water you drink, the cat is sad and shows signs of neglect. The cat is very cute and plays, eats, drinks water, or sleeps when the user has drank enough water. The cat is skinny, sad, cries, or is angry when the user opens the app and they have not drank enough water. You can do things to take care of the cat if you drink enough water

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1 challenge I had was dragging the button from the storyboard to the viewcontroller
